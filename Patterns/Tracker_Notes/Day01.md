Here’s a consolidated summary of your progress so far — combining **Day 1 and Day 2** efforts on your MLOps/DSA learning journey:

---

## ✅ **Day 1: Kickoff – Project Setup & Problem 1 (Two Pointers)**

### ✅ Python DSA Setup

* ✅ Chose Two Pointers as your first DSA pattern
* ✅ Created a PyCharm project with `.venv` for virtual environment
* ✅ Structured directories: `Patterns/Two_Pointers/Solution`

### ✅ Problem #1: Reverse String

* ✅ Implemented in-place reverse using two pointers
* ✅ Took input from user, cleaned and split it into character list
* ✅ Added logic to remove spaces
* ✅ Ensured string output was returned correctly

### ✅ Palindrome Check

* ✅ Added `palindrome_ornot()` function using two pointers
* ✅ Cleaned input, converted to lowercase
* ✅ Verified symmetry between characters from both ends

### ✅ Version Control (Git)

* ✅ Initialized Git in project
* ✅ Explored Git UI in PyCharm and terminal alternatives
* ✅ Understood concepts: `origin`, fetch vs push, remote repo
* ✅ Used terminal commands to:

  * Stage changes in `Two Pointers`
  * Commit with proper messages
  * Push (if applicable)

---

## ✅ **Day 2: Enhancements, Testing & Git Workflow Deep Dive**

### ✅ Enhancements

* ✅ Modified code structure for better returns and usability
* ✅ Added formatted output for reverse and palindrome result

### ✅ Unit Testing

* ✅ Used `unittest` (native to Python) for writing test cases
* ✅ Created test file in a separate module
* ✅ Tested:

  * `reverse_string()` function (valid/invalid cases)
  * `palindrome_ornot()` (true/false scenarios)
* ✅ Resolved module import issues between `Solution` and test file

### ✅ Git + Project Hygiene

* ✅ Created `README.md` using Markdown
* ✅ Understood README purpose and format
* ✅ Added `requirements.txt` placeholder
* ✅ Learned how to:

  * Track changes
  * Use commit dialog and Git CLI
  * Interpret Git Log, Console, and Git Tab in PyCharm
