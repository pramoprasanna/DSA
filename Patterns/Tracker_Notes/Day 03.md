### ‚úÖ **Part 1 ‚Äì DSA Concept (Python Basics Recap)**

‚è± **Time spent**: \~12 mins (18:30‚Äì18:42)

**Topics Reviewed**:

* Syntax vs Semantics
* Case sensitivity
* Commenting: `#` for single-line, `'''` for multi-line
* Indentation: important for loops, conditionals
* Mutable vs Immutable types (e.g., list vs string)
* `\` line continuation
* Multiple statements in one line using `;`
* Using `type()` to check variable type

### ‚úÖ **Part 2 ‚Äì DSA Coding (Two Pointers - Problem #3)**

‚è± **Time spent**: \~50 mins (18:42‚Äì19:32)

**LeetCode Problem #26**: *Remove Duplicates from Sorted Array*
