### ✅ **DSA + CI/CD Daily Learning Summary (Day 2)**

🕒 **Session Start:** 15:32
🕒 **Session End:** 16:28
⏱ **Total Duration:** 56 minutes

---

### 🧠 Part 1: DSA Concept – **Time Complexity**

* ✅ Reviewed time complexity of loops
* ✅ Clarified common misunderstandings (e.g., why `for j in range(i, n)` results in roughly `n²`/2 iterations)
* ✅ Summarized complexity notations (Big O)
* 🔁 Set up to start **Space Complexity** concept tomorrow

🕒 **Duration:** \~18 minutes

---

### 💻 Part 2: Solving DSA Problem – **Two Pointers #2**

* ✅ Selected and solved "Two Sum" (adjacent sum variant)
* ✅ Identified and corrected issues in initial logic
* ✅ Wrote complete solution
* ✅ Identified need to support multiple matches (to-do)
* ✅ Time captured: **15:50 to 16:28** (including fix and test discussion)

🕒 **Duration:** \~38 minutes

---

### ☁️ Part 3: CI/CD Integration – **GitHub Actions Setup**

* ✅ Created `.github/workflows` directory
* ✅ Wrote GitHub Actions YAML file
* ✅ Integrated Pytest
* ✅ Ran and passed automated tests on GitHub
* ✅ Clarified key Git terms:

  * Remote repository
  * Origin
  * Pull Request (PR)
* ✅ Successfully created a PR to test pipeline automation

🕒 **Duration:** \~10 minutes (overlapped with DSA solving at end)

---

### 📌 Outstanding / To-Do:

* Begin Space Complexity tomorrow
* Continue solving problems #3–#10 in Two Pointers pattern
